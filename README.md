# Prediction of Autism Spectrum Disorder in Children using CNNs

## Project Description
This project aims to classify Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based on facial image analysis. The project also includes a web interface for user interaction, real-time data processing, and server management to enhance usability and accessibility for early detection of ASD.

## Features
- **CNN Model for ASD Prediction**: Built using deep learning for early autism detection.
- **Web Interface**: A user-friendly interface to upload images and view predictions.
- **Real-time Processing**: Real-time image analysis for ASD prediction.
- **Server**: Backend server to handle requests and manage data flow.

## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Flask/Django (depending on the web framework used)
- OpenCV
- Additional dependencies (NumPy, Pandas, etc.)
